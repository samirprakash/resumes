### Problem that were solved:

Several teams over remote locations and different time zones are working on developing spring boot based microservices.
All the teams were working in silos using this there own tools and processes which was not ok for the one common goal for the product.
Even the members within the team are not in sync w.r.t.
- processes
- tools
- workflow
- methodologies
- automation
- continuous integration
- continuous deployment
- no information about cloud infrastructure
- no idea about DevOps
- no idea about virtualization
- no idea about containerization
- no idea about orchestration
- no idea about JAVA standards
- no idea about the development GIT workflow 
- no idea about microservices architecture
- no idea about best practices for developing, deploying and delivering modern cloud enabled products in an Agile manner

This was a process related problem that needed to be solved. The inefficiency in delivering quality products needed to be removed.

There was initial resistance to the changes that were proposed and implemented as the team members had to move away from their comfort zones. They were used to working as per their understanding which varied from individuals to individuals as well as from teams to team. This was not a healthy process as the end goal to deliver quality product and services were suffering due to this.

A lot of investment was being put by the client to enable the teams and to make then deliver and learn processes in order to deliver quality products but that was getting wasted due to the difference processes that were being followed. On top of that, the developers were also loosing quality time trying to figure out processes and ways to work around issues in order to deliver what was required from them. Overall, it was impacting the project timelines and product quality. Even the developers were not happy with the time that was getting wasted. They were not able to code, test and deliver on time. There was a lot of undue pressure that was being levied on the teams.

### Environment, technology and tools for the solution
- Docker for providing containerization solution
- CI/CD tools like Visual Studio Team Services for providing centralized build and deployment environments
- Agile processes like daily scurms, standups, product grooming, backlog grooming for smooth operations
- Atlassian cloud tools like JIRA for issue tracking and management

- Atlassian cloud tools like Confluence for documenting processes, recommendations and discussing points of view to implement changes
- CI/CD tools like Jenkins for providing continuous build and deployment pipelines
- Automated build scripts for saving time spent in building, testing and deploying code base
- Spring Boot for easy micro service code base configuration so that teams can concentrate on development rather than configuration
- Maven for dependency management
- NPM for dependency management
- Microservices architecture implemented for small chunks of development
- MVP created every release cycle in sync with the Agile process
- Create quality product which was tested, built and deployed regularly
- Use of Service Bus for intra micro service communications
- Use of Mongo DB for No-SQL document based non-relational data management
- Azure as a cloud provider for procuring resources that are required by the development teams
- Centralized management of resources required by the development teams using Azure Resource manager
- Oracle Wecker as a CI/CD tool for providing local as well as cloud solutions
- Kubernetes as a tool for orchestration management
- Kubernetes for automated creation of multiple deployments accessible to developers, end users, business users, etc.
- Local development environment creation for the developers using Docker and Minikube for faster response time on development
- GIT workflow for code management using feature based development approach
- Pull Request for code review and code merge
- Self sustained Code base release for each sprint
- Peer review using GIT process workflow
- Implementation of JAVA and JS development guidelines using centralized process flow
- Spring security for RESTful security across micro services
- Creation of common utilities for logging, pub-sub to remove rework by individual teams
- Spring configuration for centralized configuration management so that teams can concentrate on development
- RESTful standards for micro services
- Multiple environments creaated for local, dev, QA, staging and production in order to automate end to end delivery pipelines
